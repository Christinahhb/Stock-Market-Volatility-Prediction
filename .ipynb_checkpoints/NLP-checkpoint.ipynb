exploration and production oil and gas are currently from not one but two black swan first the collapse oil which the time writing have fallen around the level which they the year second the impact both directly and indirectly their course there are very significant between the two but there are also important independent vaccine for were found and everyone went back work normal tomorrow there would still oil price crisis dealt with because the decision lift supply and indeed the case and russia increase production following the failure and russia agree basis for supply their early light these many with are considering whether there anything their loan documentation that might mitigate relieve their perform whether these might constitute default grounds that adverse change that these have had might have adverse article the nature and the question force and material adverse change international those under rather than law the context these two black swan what are the key reserve base and how does oil price crash impact reserve based debt product which for some been the tool choice the armory for looking raise debt finance was the market the but longer history the where adjunct real estate although the term based and now global term there are significant between the product and its documentation between north and the rest the world however what common between both that form based the borrower debt capacity sized against future cash structured flexible and adaptable both the borrower own position the performance its and the global financial and relevant commodity within envelope facility amount the amount the borrower can draw and its repay are determined periodically borrowing base amount which the value the future net cash the the borrower group those hydrocarbon assets the have agreed treat base assets divided agreed number provide the with agreed cushion cover the ratio borrowing base amount typically twice year through process known one the key net cash oil gas and the will set the deck both for the current year and future each redetermination normal the current price deck will material discount spot the time the redetermination and future will discount the relevant commodity price forward curve though times extreme volatility this discount not always applied product which inherently adaptable contrast most other debt which not expand and contract with and which rely financial that produce binary outcome compliance default usually taking backwards look the balance sheet and the and out with the and forward look cash the normal ebb and flow commodity price this works well for all but what when the oil price dramatically this year and did between late and early the challenge for that the very point their cash are hit falling commodity they also find their credit hit although are well structured and and have number provide early and provide cushion they like all other debt are not set operate serenely the once century storm least not that storm sustained one oil price crash that the global financial crisis actually produced very few the international market but did produce some the last oil price crash produced much more widespread default and since taken place with that experience fairly recent memory against the backdrop the last oil price crash been more cautious than was the exuberant days that and are generally more whether mandatorily because the have voluntarily because have thought prudent this that many are well additionally are generally being very quick curtail expenditure but what the crisis and those are not enough against this background have advice force and and have been considering the ambit facility that relate material adverse change force with three rather minor way exception probably fair say that and loan more generally never contain force anything equivalent them borrower obligation pay then absolute obligation pay come indeed for that matter the borrower other perform under loan agreement such positive negative while the performance particular obligation may tempered for instance that obligation rather than absolute obligation loan not excuse performance grounds force anything minor note are provision very common documentation for the borrower have information that could impacted force the borrower notify the agent for instance the borrower force notice the borrower any key contractual impacted force event the information the loan agreement should concept event the loan market association model form loan documentation concept event which may give very short grace period before event default the case the borrower lender becomes lender the case lender that party unable pay the case the borrower fund the case lender the due date the duration the grace period matter for negotiation between the and will set out the loan agreement but typically only two three are two the definition event the first something which impacted the whole market and the second something which may specific the borrower another party the loan agreement the first limb disruption those payment communication those financial which are each case operate order for made connection with the otherwise order for the the finance carried out which disruption not and beyond the control any the for instance the entire swift system goes down this might covered the first second limb occurrence any other event which disruption technical nature the treasury party that any other party from its payment under the finance from communicating with other accordance with the the finance and which either such case not and beyond the control the party whose are both are about whether party can actually effect the mechanics making payment not about whether the money make the payment the first limb about market wide event and the second event which may impact only one party both concern technical making one can see that have the potential cause disruption event but clearly these have relevance the context commodity price however affecting agent bank fronting bank finally the model form acquisition loan agreement provision the agency section which the agent and any fronting bank issuing bank from any liability for result act circumstance not reasonably within its control the clause goes give list such failure transport natural god but these are just whilst are not listed protection given for act not reasonably within its control one can see that depending the failure agent properly perform its function due similar resulting from the potential these material adverse change other which have adverse effect borrower whether that related oil price collapse any other adverse event there are typically two key loan that need one the section and the other the default section though there will usually many other which are qualified adverse effect language material adverse change there are course the language for this representation across different loan but the material adverse change representation usually along the the date the most recent financial the agent there been material adverse change the assets business financial condition the key thing check with this representation whether given only the date the loan agreement whether representation there strong logic for this representation not representation particularly where there are cover and financial monitor the ongoing the and the asset cover provided the borrowing base assets precise and quantitative way nonetheless common see this representation representation and accordingly borrower should carefully consider its ability give this representation against the backdrop recent mac mae event default very very common and indeed grade documentation more generally for there event default adverse change there are naturally multiple how mac mae are defined loan but typically these will require there material adverse change the assets financial condition the borrower group therefore historic look back test that said quite common also find there being material adverse change the the borrower group which prospective forward looking test and very vague also common for mac mae include reference ability obligor perform its payment material under the finance transaction whilst the that oil and gas are facing could lead trigger their ability make payment the have the rare material adverse change that the change question must substantially affecting the relevant party ability perform the obligation and that the change must not temporary are also whether the test objective whether common the majority acting reasonably have the right determine that the event with resulting event default they the mac event default worry for would say generally not have never seen one being bank group this sector the finance market and indeed have never seen threaten call one the reason for this that mac not precise concept and were call mac event default error the potential liability for those could practice not accelerate enforce security until event default such breach financial covenant event default addition the context there already

downstream the tenant the form greater tenant and the need recalibrate lease with the ongoing business climate applicable commercial real estate case law north and law force are very narrowly addition and independent from force clause party from under contract when performance becomes objectively impossible due god which are outside party control prevent avoid the relevant statute have that any

not excuse contract performance impossible have that for governmental action excuse performance under force provision the party this defense need not show the governmental action performance impossible however the party must show that the act government had more than just effect the contract one court the following governmental insufficient excuse contract performance from the collapse world oil the government found insufficient excuse performance coal contract monetary control and the put place the government the early resulting slump the timber market not enough excuse party from

denial the tenant license operate law school was not enough excuse the tenant obligation pay rent that case the lease specifically the obligation pay rent from the force clause the court also the tenant defense purpose because the lease the used for lawful purpose and not just for the intended use further the lease the tenant assign sublet the for another purpose but the current situation with government temporary closure many likely distinguishable and will present argument for temporarily law failure performance when performance the operation law even though there may have been stipulation that this shall not excuse new and other governmental that render performance impossible provide defense the obligor for example case found that lease for certain used specifically liquor store was inoperative prohibition however performance merely more difficult more expensive such government order the defense another case the force provision supply agreement between supplier hypertension medication and pharmaceutical company excusing breach the supplier regulatory governmental action did not either under the express the provision common law encompass the food and drug administration shutdown plant which produced the drug for federal the force provision was vague and and thus did not indicate assumption risk the pharmaceutical company and the agreement additional

economy and specifically order secure support under the before funds are exhausted may choose submit without the same careful review that usually for loan other payment due time pressure loan also may not able fully vet before issuing funds additionally the act and the are currently devoid and significant guidance while this likely change the near future small that have applied for and received funds before the issuance such guidance are essentially blind and thereby risk themselves the dust from the and financial crises inevitable that the department justice and the relator bar will initiate tam recover funds allegedly from the government false fraudulent manner this reality likely mirror enforcement taken the wake the financial crisis recover funds under the asset relief program which were extensive and record for the government result small for and should proceed with caution the next several are likely defined substantial government enforcement and tam surrounding the swift

potential exposure under the treble damages steep monetary and the payment given that loan forgiveness and related are and the small that seek funds are subject liability set forth below and related that heighten the exposure for small additionally because they are ultimately forgivable the funds are used for eligible effectively function small this potential grant status the risk government scrutiny and investigation into for and utilization and seeking funds must certify certain for determination eligibility receive funds specifically the must certify faith that the uncertainty current economic necessary the loan request support the ongoing the eligible recipient funds will used retain and maintain payroll make mortgage lease and utility the eligible recipient does not have application pending for loan for the same purpose and duplicative applied for received under covered loan and during the period beginning and ending the eligible recipient not received under section the small business act for the same purpose and duplicative applied for received under covered loan false potentially expose applicant liability under the those are have been false when made liability can triggered surrounding that are either expressed the nature the leaves ample room for the government and bring for example the are currently coupled with significant ambiguity related part the following what the specific meaning faith connection with what are the for making receipt funds support ongoing what funds were used for eligible payroll mortgage lease utility but also were allegedly used for some unstated purpose what investment funds private equity own smaller does this preclude the smaller from the business under the while additional and other guidance these may forthcoming the current ambiguity potential liability exposure for small because the rapid payment funds regarding the use faith unclear whether the term inclusion the any effect potential exposure the government and could argue that must always made good faith when through the lens liability similarly the act does not attempt explicate the that may may not support small business moreover uncertainty surrounding what the term might fully encompass and whether payroll mortgage lease and utility are private equity and investment funds even for such private equity and investment funds the loan process also potential through their direct and control over small for example certainly conceivable that the government might argue that private equity firm investment company was not small business but affiliate submit order receive millions from the government that should have been liability under the can extend and that cause submit false and make false private equity and investment funds may find themselves the future surrounding the this potential risk are the fact that some have already expressed commitment hedge funds and private equity that are improperly seek funds under the through their otherwise compliance with not shield against liability given that the act only recently law there are and very little guidance assist small some the surrounding that create potential exposure under the one the primary guidance that currently surrounding the the frequently the maintain part may rely the guidance provided this document interpretation the act and the interim final rule the government will not challenge lender that conform this guidance and the interim final rule and any subsequent effect the time its face this guidance offer some insulation from liability for small funds however this apparent safe harbor unlikely result meaningful from exposure specifically whether guidance question this room for interpretation room for liability such the government could argue that any small deviation from the guidance grounds for also important note that over the past few taken somewhat shifting regarding whether government guidance and defendant contrary such guidance can the sole primary basis for liability for example memorandum the memo the from enforcement authority effectively convert agency guidance into binding since then substantially this position such that there considerable lack clarity whether and what extent contrary guidance can form basis for liability this ambiguity particularly relevant the application process above light express statement that certification can still enforced even the absence equivalent statutory regulatory requirement the uncertainty the supreme court recently that regulatory guidance that substantive legal standard can not given effect unless goes through formal period the did not undergo the period argument can made under health that the government and can not rely noncompliance with the without more establish liability however the notable lack clarity regarding the potential role regulatory guidance liability itself the government with guidance the basis for action against government recovery strategy pay and then chase the volume loan and the speed with which they are being the government ability vet the legitimacy each payment impossible prior the nationwide spread and the enactment the act the government this issue surrounding the times crisis specifically the office inspector general congress and government accountability office have that disaster have been vulnerable fraud and the past because loan are often expedited order provide quick relief disaster and disaster personnel who are brought into the quickly may lack enough training experience the same apply and may particularly pronounced during the pandemic given the paralysis the nation economy across multiple and the speed with which the process and distribute during the biggest fiscal year approximately billion however the act the issue more than ten times the amount those few order meet the needs the crisis this expedited will likely lead certain payment and unqualified funds which they are not because the paying funds expediently possible meet the emergent the current crises the the and other government enforcement pursue improperly distributed funds after they are this and then chase tactic certainly nothing new and often the government approach federal other such health care the current crisis unique the volume government over short period time and the direct connection between the and pervasive national crisis will likely trigger substantial enforcement for several this position recent history the wake the financial crisis the government quickly distributed funds under tarp the that immediately government and enforcement led accounting for the lion share the nearly billion fiscal year must also keep mind was seen some federal funds received during the financial crisis and subsequent seemingly minor technical understandable during emergency period can fraud after the unclear this stage what might look like surrounding the receipt the financial crisis and the payment funds provide powerful comparator and potential harbinger the landscape that may lie key recognition the unique emergency nature the crisis and the inclusion the faith language compliance the loan application process may evidence the government intent provide loan more room avoid exposure this uncertain time other enforcement federal have that they are uninterested and making genuine operate legally and compliantly while uncharted during the pandemic enforcement scenario could point the current the act and conformance with guidance seeking refute liability however given the current lack specific case law and the unique nature the crisis unclear how much traction this line argument may hold the context brought against additionally even the government not bring enforcement action against particular borrower that borrower could still subject tam action brought the government these should extremely diligent loan provide accurate information and should meticulously document how funds are used although the present are exigent and uncertain many loan will likely subjected the government and once the crisis particular concerned about their eligibility under the program private equity and

more than trillion inflation nary tick well that did maybe trillion balance sheet will will you give trillion hard see how all that debt that now and about added both public and private balance can dealt with through taxation the top only course profitability and growth real meaningful inflation will slouch back into because through combination the sort inadvertence that got its empire and intentional policy both overt and covert going inflate our way out this mess good hold assets bad hold job these become wisdom they will inform the path how our adjust and what the finance will look like for probably more more that made the monthly payment word from both the space and the space that most rent for march consensus that may and that rent both personal and commercial and consequently debt service will deeply starting with the payment due during the first two may and that going for the industry the commercial debt are getting ready embrace forbearance least for relatively short period time with the already put stake the ground around forbearance with right request another days under the act hard think about almost anything else grudgingly enthusiastically capital market life and other will generally reach with their borrower for forbearance the short term already seen and set the stage for between and and that will become one the most popular and common legal over the next month two practice point you are lender and you have one one lot sense right now for bunch but one horrible glaring weakness first the case for doing sort the national interest this really time get punctilious about contractual language and begin the aggressive enforcement loan think first you lender you think you going succeed are closed and god when they will reopen the public narrative that all this together and you about popular dry cough crowded room you are taking advantage crisis aggressively loan will not sympathetic and know what when the are emotionally the borrower corner you want see bad law bad have because that what going happen will temporary bad law will with there not really need hurry there typical downturn assets continue fall value economy down here the damage was largely done day one closed closed there just not much upside acting will just accelerate the vicious cycle fire leading fire leading lower asset under the balance and will these and internal the loan book will infect all other asset classes leading cycle deflation the value all assets and the need further dispose assets fire sale round and round that wound circular firing squad done before was fun then right ready for more fun now one can take the position now that forbearance not debt and not recently federal the financial account standard board and even congress gave chance avoid debt designation and all that light the current crisis under section the act congress provided that any modification loan related between march and the either the day after the end the national emergency would not seen debt following suit the comptroller the currency the federal reserve the consumer financial protection bureau the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration banded together grant relief short term related not covered the act incredibly good will cushion the impact the virus impact the loan book and maybe one the more consequential the government done also the view that properly structured forbearance does not constitute asset becoming asset often significant negative effects appraisal termination advancing change control and number other chaotic the pattern contractual and the space writ large contractual order something that fundamentally bad idea fact working definition going helpful not good looking and flawed comparison the version for only legacy conduit count and new issue conduit were out the jury out whether not but reasonable ask and hopefully the that will allow assets said flawed one shot deal the way with the program expiring the end that does not leave lot time since money invest new strategy get overnight moreover they only into the arms could actually get done and get many before only conduit see much the traditional conduit empty out the cupboard paper before this and that will good chance lost note for those who really embrace anxiety and have nothing better the eligible borrower definition the new term sheet broken scope out all fund think that drafting error and our trade are right now pressing for clarity and expect get but relief program which designed unavailable the only investable like catch when you could only see major major when was does need just get fixed needs get fixed expect the eligible borrower thing get fixed and then the program will help should what its intended which bring first the legacy market and then positive effect the new issue market the way think billion raised buy legacy with haircut that effectively the same thing billion new capacity thought exercise just imagine the bearing again came back and said they buy billion positive impact sure enough might actually enough reopen the capital for some type transactional activity the near other program worth the new protection program from the small business administration program popular have already run out however when for does seem question when and not for those who qualify this virtually free money interest are low are low documentation get into the program low and funds used for qualified have back and unsecured just does get better than that been said that documentation and might violate certain foundational structured finance but really free money let find way facilitate the access the program going helpful for all but super helpful for the hospitality industry where already been allow hotel draw funds even when are technically employed the related management say again free money except for all who will ultimately have pay back but deal with that later see comment about inflation above also watching the rating what are they going may they take the position which beginning hear the appraisal industry taking that the proper way look the commercial real estate assets basis with haircut for short term interruption recently fired warning shot over the bow regarding the impact the downturn future this harbinger come really need round aggressive they are hardly necessary alert that there virus out there and bad stuff obviously are not good for the market place but they particularly not good the extent that drop out the top two highest rating classes cross the investment grade meniscus both which have significant for the ability certain hold and could result bond dumping the market place that itself could offset all the positive and the other fiscal and keep closed that take this that forbearance largely good but one deep and troublesome flaw forbearance will only last for the short term and the problem will not short term one the from the great recession that extend and pretend actually sort worked but deep you hold assets through the trough and enjoy the upside the other end our now increasingly bathtub looking recession and did have monetize your then look pretty good but that strategy will not universally available when failure pay and economic not right themselves rapidly there will enormous pressure exercise that what the the and said should done some enforcement will begin even though the business know their heart hearts that lead good outcome you can get fired for bad forbearance strategy will begin wobble and ultimately fail sometime the days beyond the day that the currently fashionable forbearance period the market will simply have deal with the political cost writ large actually will diminish and will increasingly clear that this relatively long trudge back for those special who are tad pouty that they may not get resolution out the forbearance process worry all regrettably you get second bite that worry inflation the way and inflation will what does best and make repaying debt easier the market accustomed the dual the duration this downturn and the recognition that inflation finally will change behavior both the buy and the sell side grab low fixed rate loan and wait for the tsunami give fixed rate loan and worry about the deterioration the value the asset because inflation and pay with

formed plan ways reduce the trajectory the white house and congressional lengthy over grand bargain reduce future entitlement spending those came naught but not only did debt crisis occur the opposite interest and inflation have stayed persistently low for the last decade and demand for treasury very high with the economy now free fall even many fiscal are embracing deficit spending help the

should for their the system won function properly every time there major crisis the bad get the fed could inadvertently another asset bubble right now although comforting that those lucky tapping the capital are paying much higher interest than they have seem have finally the meaning risk the fed least for while may have saved the pension funds and police which often buy the risky from far worse order rescue those retirement funds and some have live with the fed then that worth making the fed was for such this one and blessing that forcefully such times there are always few who somehow see
